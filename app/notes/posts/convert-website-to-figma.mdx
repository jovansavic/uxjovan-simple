**Rebuilding UI that already exists, eyeballing spacing values, and manually recreating every button, card, and nav component in Figma, sucks💩**. So we built **Web Mode**: a browser extension that captures any website and converts it into structured, editable Figma files.

~Not screenshots. Not flat images~. **❖ Actual layers, extracted styles, and semantic naming.**

---

### I What can Web Mode capture?

Public websites, Localhost *(`localhost:3000`)*, Staging environments behind VPN, Authenticated pages *after login*, Specific states *(modals open, dropdowns expanded, error messages visible)* **If your browser can render it, Web Mode can capture it.**


---

### II How Web Mode Works: 

**Capture, Convert, Design**

**1. Capture:** Install the browser extension (Chrome, Safari, or Firefox). Navigate to any page. Click the `Clone Website` .

---

**2. Convert:** Open the Web Mode Figma plugin. Click Paste from Extension.
Web Mode reconstructs the captured DOM as native Figma elements:
**Colors**, **typography**, and **shadows** map to extractable Figma styles. **Images** and **SVGs** embed as assets. Layer names derive from semantic HTML class names."

---

**3. Design:** Your capture arrives as an editable frame. Change copy. Adjust spacing. Swap colors. Everything behaves like you built it yourself—because in Figma's eyes, you did.


---
### III When is needed?

**Design system drift.** Your team shipped features faster than you could document them. The Figma library is now a museum of what you *intended* to build, not what's actually live. You need to reverse-engineer production to catch up.

**Competitive analysis theater.** You're "analyzing" a competitor's interface by taking screenshots and squinting. You can't measure their spacing. You can't extract their colors accurately. You can't overlay their patterns against yours.

**The missing source files problem.** The client's website/saas exists. The original design files don't. Before you can propose improvements, you need to rebuild what's already there from scratch.

**Dev-design drift.** Miss-match between production and mockups. Now there's no single source of truth, and every conversation about *"what it should look like"* involves someone sharing their screen and saying *"well, actually..."*

**Every hour spent rebuilding existing UI is an hour not spent on decisions that matter.**

### IV Limitations worth knowing


No tool handles everything. Web Mode is powerful, but not magic. Here are some current limitations:

Animations don't translate - Figma doesn't support layer-level animation. If the font isn't installed locally or available through Figma's font service, you'll get a fallback. Canvas and WebGL may rasterize. Dynamic content captures as static. React state, real-time data, conditionally rendered elements, you get a snapshot of the current render.

For typical marketing pages, dashboards, and SaaS interfaces: **expect 80-95% accuracy**. The remaining 5-20% is usually edge cases that would need manual cleanup regardless of how you captured them.
